# WuzzufTask
As the required was two tasks, I wasn't able to install elasticsearch server on my machine, I just added comments where the indexing should happen on the code. 

I worked on a sample of hotels to get you the output you needed. The number of hotels in the database was around 21000 and the allowed Watson calls was around 2500. I just wrote the code to provide the requirments exactly.
