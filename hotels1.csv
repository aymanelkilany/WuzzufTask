The hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. Assisted in booking tickets for the opera. The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast.Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there.",Good location on the Lido.,,Julie,,POINT(12.376187 45.421611)

I thought I was staying in wine country. It would also have been nice to know that it is under construction. Granted I should have done more research but it was a last minute decision to go. The only good thing I could say is the bed was comfortable. If you are looking for a hotel right off of a freeway this one fits the bill, although way overpriced.",Not what I expected,,Debra,,POINT(-121.77371 37.698349)

The add stated it was oceanfront, it wasnt! the front door would not lock. It had gray duct on the lock section, which was painted it over. It appeared to be a place for squatters. It was not safe. The furniture was old, outdated and it smelled. And we couldn't get a refund!","could not get a refund, so we had to stay!",,Jordan,,POINT(-75.98443 36.84766)

The rooms were fine. There was a mini fridge, microwave, hair dryer, and ironing board/iron. However the showers were awful. The water would get scalding hot and then ice cold. At first we thought it was because everyone was returning from the beach but it continued. The Hotel is in a great location-5 block walk to beach, boardwalk, restaurants, shops and entertainment. The pool was nice with not many people there. All in all experience was fine-I would probably return because the price was good and the only bad thing was the showers.","could not get a refund, so we had to stay!",,A Traveler,,POINT(-75.98443 36.84766)
